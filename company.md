# üè¢ DevOps Zero ‚Äî Company Overview

**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Platform Team  
**Last Updated:** {{date}}  
**Applies To:** All members, collaborators, and contributors of the DevOps Zero organization.

## üåç 1. Mission Statement

> ‚ÄúTo build a zero-cost, fully automated DevOps ecosystem that anyone can use to learn, deploy, and scale software safely.‚Äù

DevOps Zero exists to **democratize DevOps learning and operations** by providing open-source infrastructure, automation, and monitoring systems modeled after real production environments ‚Äî without commercial dependencies or cloud costs.

---

## üöÄ 2. Vision

> ‚ÄúEnable every engineer to operate like an SRE ‚Äî with automation, observability, and resilience from day one.‚Äù

We envision a world where:

* **Learning DevOps = building real systems**, not reading theory.  
* **Automation is default**, not optional.  
* **Security and reliability** are built-in, not bolted-on.  
* **Failure is educational**, not catastrophic.

---

## üí° 3. Core Values

| Value | Description |
| ------ | ------------ |
| **Automation First** | Every repetitive or error-prone task must be automated. Manual steps indicate a missing script or workflow. |
| **Transparency** | All code, configurations, and decisions live in version control. No ‚Äútribal knowledge.‚Äù |
| **Reliability over Speed** | Ship slower if necessary ‚Äî stability comes first. |
| **Security by Default** | Secrets are never committed, and all systems are hardened before release. |
| **Continuous Learning** | Every incident produces a runbook, every failure becomes an improvement. |
| **Open Collaboration** | All documentation and automation are public by default to encourage contribution and reuse. |

## üß© 4. Organizational Structure

| Team | Purpose | Key Deliverables | Owner |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| **Platform** | CI/CD, automation, reusable workflows | `platform-ci` | You |
| **Infra** | Terraform + Ansible infrastructure provisioning | `infra-terraform`, `infra-ansible` | You |
| **Apps** | Core applications and API services (Python, Go) | `apps-python-api`, `apps-go-service` | You |
| **K8s** | Kubernetes orchestration, deployment pipelines | `k8s-platform` | You |

## üîí 5. Governance Principles

1. **Everything as Code:** Infrastructure, configuration, pipelines, and policies are version-controlled.  
2. **Change Through Pull Requests:** Every modification requires review and audit trail.  
3. **No Secrets in Code:** Secrets managed via environment stores or encrypted vaults.  
4. **Observability Everywhere:** All systems expose metrics before production.  
5. **Fail Loudly, Fix Quickly:** MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) < 30 minutes goal.  
6. **Post-Incident Learning:** Every outage results in a runbook and RCA.  
7. **Open Learning Environment:** All documentation and automation are open-source.
